A JavaScript library for generating unique IDs.

## Overview

**kinoid** generates ID as strings made up of numbers and the 26 lowercase characters of the English
alphabet; every string generated by kinoid can be considered as a base-36 number.

The generated ID is _unique_ because, no matter how many IDs are generated, no ID will ever be the
same as one generated previously, nor as any ID that will be generated subsequently, nor as any ID
generated _simultaneously_ in any other process running on the same machine.

### Features

Each ID is composed of a timestamp, representing milliseconds since the UNIX epoch. Then a number
that identifies the process in which the program runs. The final number is a "serialization value"
or "singularity factor" that guarantees the uniqueness of the ID.

IDs are sortable by time, because they are based on the time they were created. Additionally, the
time an ID was created can be calculated from the ID itself thanks to the `decodeId()` function
which returns an object containing, among other things, the date on which that ID was generated.

### Warning

**IDs are not passwords**. Kinoid ensures that each generated id is _unique_, no one has ever been
created the same and will never happen in the future. Kinoid is not intended to create
cryptographically secure strings.

## Requirements

`Node` version 8 or later.

## Installation

```bash
npm install kinoid
```

## How to use

### `import`

```javascript
import kinoid from "kinoid";
const { newId, decodeId } = kinoid();

const id = newId();

console.log(id);
// 26cgyty8lts9s831q

console.log(`The id '${id}' was generated on ${decodeId(id).date.toDateString()}`);
// The id '26cgyty8lts9s831q' was generated on Tue Nov 19 2024
```

### `require`

```javascript
const { newId } = require("kinoid")();

const newBook = {
  title: "Love at the time of the inquisition",
  author: "John White",
  publisher: "Hypercubes",
  id: newId(),
};

db.add(newBook);
```
