A JavaScript library for generating unique IDs.

## Overview

**kinoid** generates ID as 24-character long strings made up of numbers and the 26 lowercase
characters of the English alphabet; every string generated by kinoid can be considered as a base-36
number consisting of 24 digits.

The generated ID is _unique_ because, no matter how many IDs are generated, no ID will ever be the
same to one generated previously nor to any ID that will be generated subsequently nor to any ID
generated _simultaneously_ in any other process running on the same machine.

### Warning

**IDs are not passwords**. Kinoid ensures that each generated id is unique, no one has ever been
created the same and will never happen in the future. Kinoid is not intended to create
cryptographically secure strings.

If you are interested in a library for creating cryptographically secure passwords, try
